# Description:

This project is a front-end app I made using React for my friend's API about a few games he likes. Given the content, I wanted to make something with a similar look to GameStop.

### [Michel's Game API deployed on Heroku](https://github.com/game-api7.herokuapp.com/api/games).

### [Michel's Game API repo on GitHub](https://github.com/Michel9510/Game-API)

## Getting Started:

In your terminal copy and paste the following and hit enter to start cloning the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/MannyNR/Michel-Game-Api-Frontend.git
```

Then change into the project's directory by entering the following:

```
cd michel-game-api-frontend/
```

In the project directory, you can run to install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Once dependencies are installed, you can now run the following:

```
npm start
```

This will run the app in the your browser under [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or similar port in case you already have port 3000 in use.

## No mediaquery support however, I used clamp and flex box to achieve responsive-ish behavior.

## Future plans:

This is just an MVP and Michel and I hope to collaborate more in the future by adding more titles to the api and also adding more features to the site

Thanks for stopping by and stay tuned for future updates!
